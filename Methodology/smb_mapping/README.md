Absolutely! Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the Zeek queries for analyzing `smb_mapping.log` using `cat` and `zeek-cut`. 

### Accurate Zeek Queries for `smb_mapping.log`

1. **View All SMB Operations**
   This query retrieves all SMB operations logged in the `smb_mapping.log`.

   ```bash
   cat smb_mapping.log | zeek-cut -d '\t' ts uid id.orig_h id.orig_p id.resp_h id.resp_p connection_id operation
   ```

2. **Count SMB Operations by Source IP**
   This query counts how many SMB operations each source IP performed.

   ```bash
   cat smb_mapping.log | zeek-cut -d '\t' id.orig_h operation | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
   ```

3. **Identify Unique Connections**
   To identify unique SMB connections and their respective operations, you can use:

   ```bash
   cat smb_mapping.log | zeek-cut -d '\t' id.orig_h id.orig_p id.resp_h id.resp_p connection_id operation | sort -u
   ```

4. **Filter for Specific SMB Operations (e.g., Create, Delete)**
   If you want to filter for specific operations such as `Create` and `Delete`, use:

   ```bash
   cat smb_mapping.log | zeek-cut -d '\t' ts id.orig_h id.orig_p id.resp_h id.resp_p connection_id operation | grep -E "Create|Delete"
   ```

5. **Count Operations Per Connection**
   This query counts how many operations each SMB connection has performed.

   ```bash
   cat smb_mapping.log | zeek-cut -d '\t' connection_id operation | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
   ```

6. **Identify Suspicious Source IPs**
   To identify source IPs that are performing an unusually high number of SMB operations, you can combine sorting and counting:

   ```bash
   cat smb_mapping.log | zeek-cut -d '\t' id.orig_h | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 10
   ```

7. **Track Operations Over Time**
   If you want to track SMB operations over a specific time range, for example, within the last hour, you can adjust the `ts` filtering accordingly.

   ```bash
   cat smb_mapping.log | zeek-cut -d '\t' ts id.orig_h operation | awk -v date="$(date -d '1 hour ago' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')" '$1 > date'
   ```

8. **List All Operations to a Specific Destination**
   To see all SMB operations directed at a specific destination IP, replace `DEST_IP` with the actual IP address:

   ```bash
   cat smb_mapping.log | zeek-cut -d '\t' ts id.orig_h id.orig_p operation | grep 'DEST_IP'
   ```

### Conclusion
These queries should help you effectively analyze the `smb_mapping.log` using `zeek-cut` to gain insights into SMB activities. Adjust the commands as necessary to fit your specific requirements or environment.
